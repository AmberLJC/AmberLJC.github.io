Greetings~~ My name is [Amber(Jiachen) Liu](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~amberljc/). Fourth year CS PhD advised by [Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/). My research interest mainly falls on machine learning resource management. I have maintain paper lists for [federated learning systems](https://github.com/AmberLJC/FLsystem-paper) and [LLM systems](https://github.com/AmberLJC/LLMSys-PaperList/) . I am open to discussing research ideas and seeking academic collaborations. Drop me email if interested!
